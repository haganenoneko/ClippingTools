Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.10,0:04:49.15,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I think it was Meika-kun's call-in stream or something
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.15,0:04:51.18,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I was like, "Oh! Ichinose-san's here!",
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.18,0:04:52.75,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,so I sent you a friend request

Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.55,0:05:04.21,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Well, I suddenly got a friend request from you,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.21,0:05:08.92,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,so I thought I might have done something
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.92,0:05:11.49,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I was pretty surprised, so I decided to
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.49,0:05:14.01,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,just send you a hand wave for starters
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.01,0:05:16.75,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, so you were just testing out the waters with that?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.30,0:05:20.70,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I sent it like, "Ah, did you need something?"

Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.50,0:05:25.68,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,but I didn't think you were the type to
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.68,0:05:28.67,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,send a hand wave, but you did! Seeing that,

Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.21,0:05:34.18,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,hand waving type," so I waved my hand back
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.18,0:05:38.47,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Right, like, "Hello" "Good afternoon"
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.47,0:05:41.50,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Right, and after saying stuff like "Nice to meet you" and

Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.84,0:05:48.32,Translator,,0,0,0,,TLN: after Tamaki shows her good intentions, Ichinose replies that she had mistakenly assumed why Tamaki wanted to talk to her.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.84,0:05:47.32,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I got something like, "Ah, I was wrong"

Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.40,0:06:05.50,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,you would wonder why I was contacting you, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.50,0:06:08.88,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, in the first place, I don't really participate
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.88,0:06:11.83,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,in the FPS scene, so there wasn't much chance
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.83,0:06:14.47,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,for us to be in the same Discord server.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.47,0:06:17.80,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So when we were in Meika's server, I saw that Ichinose
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.80,0:06:20.79,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,was there, and thought, "Lucky!", and sent you a
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.79,0:06:22.88,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,friend request, but it seems like
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.88,0:06:24.92,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,you were a bit surprised by that
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.92,0:06:29.31,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I was actually happy about it. I mean, it's not often
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.31,0:06:32.75,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,that you get friend requests, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.75,0:06:36.12,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, I guess not
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.12,0:06:39.42,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,But someone like me, who just randomly sends
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.42,0:06:42.82,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,friend requests, is quite rare, especially in
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.82,0:06:46.92,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,this industry, where most people are fairly reticent.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.92,0:06:50.01,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I saw it and was happy about it
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.01,0:06:51.67,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Thank you very much
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.67,0:06:54.96,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,That said, after I invited you for this stream,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.96,0:06:58.78,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,which you accepted, it's been several months, but have
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.78,0:07:03.10,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,you ever been on any other talking-focused streams?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.10,0:07:08.34,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Personally, I don't really think of myself as very suitable
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.34,0:07:13.23,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,for such streams, but Tamaki's conversation streams are
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.23,0:07:16.30,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,you know, quite well-known, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.30,0:07:19.72,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, well, the guests are well-known, yup.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.72,0:07:23.79,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I had seen a couple of them, and thought they were
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.79,0:07:26.54,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,interesting, so I was really happy
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.54,0:07:28.41,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,when you invited me on
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.41,0:07:32.52,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,As damage control, I preemptively said,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.78,0:07:36.81,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,with me, I'd be glad to participate."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.81,0:07:40.56,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Right, you were like, "I'm totally ill-suited for this,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.56,0:07:43.93,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,and I don't know if I'll be able to talk, is that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.93,0:07:47.04,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,okay?", and I said that that was totally fine
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.04,0:07:52.41,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, some say I have Predator-level communication skills
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.41,0:07:56.12,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,For real, my intent today was to completely rely on you
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.12,0:07:59.27,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Today, when we were meeting up, I asked Ichinose,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.27,0:08:02.87,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Is it alright if I'm really talkative today?," and she was like,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.87,0:08:06.18,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Oh, I came today hoping you'd do exactly that, so I'd
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.18,0:08:09.38,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,be in a bit of a pinch if we can't make that happen"
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.38,0:08:11.05,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's what I was thinking coming into this.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.05,0:08:13.50,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Thank you, then let's get talking a bunch
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.50,0:08:18.98,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I plan to talk about a lot of different topics with Nose today
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.78,0:08:23.44,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Okay, then, how about we start with the first question?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.24,0:08:26.07,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Alright, let's see what it is
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.07,0:08:28.75,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Please tell us how you came to know of each other
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.75,0:08:31.38,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,and what your respective first impressions were."
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.38,0:08:35.13,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, this is a fairly orthodox opener, but let's see..
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.13,0:08:37.49,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san, do you remember when you
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.49,0:08:39.72,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,first learned of Inuyama Tamaki?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.72,0:08:43.77,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Inuyama Tamaki.. it was probably a clip, but I don't
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.77,0:08:47.38,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,remember which one specifically, since it was a
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.38,0:08:51.21,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,while ago, but I think you were with Kagura Mea...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.21,0:08:56.76,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,The clip was absolutely not wholesome at all,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.76,0:08:59.88,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,if I had to say, it was downright nasty.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.88,0:09:03.44,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I watched that and thought it was interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.44,0:09:06.07,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's how I learned of you.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.07,0:09:09.50,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,That's a terrible way to do so
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.50,0:09:12.98,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,My impression of you was... fairly... strong...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.98,0:09:15.67,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So you probably thought of me as someone
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.67,0:09:18.58,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,who got along with and resembled Kagura Mea
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.58,0:09:21.04,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's right
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.04,0:09:23.10,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,That kind of first impression... I don't like it..
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.10,0:09:26.75,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I imagined you to be a foul-mouthed sort of person
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.75,0:09:28.64,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, I see
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.30,0:09:29.75,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I came with that impression
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.75,0:09:33.10,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,But, now, you think of me as a strong communicator, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.10,0:09:37.12,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, now.. I think you're good at talking, and, I
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.12,0:09:40.89,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,: also, your thumbnails are really good, cute,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.89,0:09:44.15,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,and easy on the eyes. Something like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.58,0:09:48.12,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I'd totally be willing to make thumbnails for you
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.12,0:09:50.93,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Actually, recently.. Recently?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.93,0:09:55.04,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I bought *that* recently, you know, Photoshop
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.80,0:09:55.16,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Recently?!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.16,0:09:57.10,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san, how long have you been a VTuber for, again?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.10,0:09:59.90,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Three years..
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.07,0:09:59.50,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Oh, man, it's been a while
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.72,0:10:01.50,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I bought it to commemorate 3 years
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.50,0:10:04.07,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,To commemorate three years, huh? I see, so three years
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.07,0:10:06.12,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,is the bare minimum before using Photoshop.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.12,0:10:08.60,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,So, I bought it and started looking at how
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.60,0:10:11.63,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,other people were making their thumbnails, and, while
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.63,0:10:14.35,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I was doing that, I saw Tamaki-san's thumbnails
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.35,0:10:15.44,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Really? That makes me glad
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.44,0:10:17.15,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I thought they were good
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.15,0:10:19.67,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san, I can teach you how to use Photoshop
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.67,0:10:22.18,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Please do so
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.18,0:10:24.41,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I want to run a thumbnail making course
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.41,0:10:26.58,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I really want you to do so
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.58,0:10:29.10,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Should I? Let's do it over at Nose-san's channel, then
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.10,0:10:33.04,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Please, I'll watch the archive over and over
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.04,0:10:35.04,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,You're really keen about this, aren't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.61,0:10:35.27,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I'll use it as reference
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.27,0:10:39.11,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, moving on from thumbnails, how I first found
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.11,0:10:43.22,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,out, how I first *properly* found out, about Nose-san
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.22,0:10:46.64,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,actually had something to do with Kagura Mea
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.64,0:10:48.85,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I was searching about myself on the Internet,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.85,0:10:51.17,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,and there were results about Kagura Mea and how
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.17,0:10:53.45,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,her room was, well, can't be said to be clean,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.45,0:10:56.20,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,as it's freaking disgusting, but, Nose-san's room,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.20,0:11:00.25,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,without sugar-coating it, is pretty bad, too, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.30,0:11:01.32,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's true ww
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.58,0:11:03.03,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So, with this uncommon common ground, you and
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.03,0:11:05.67,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Kagura Mea were seen as "comrades in filth," and
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.67,0:11:08.78,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,there were search results expressing a desire to see the
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.78,0:11:11.78,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,two of you duke it out over the filthiness of your rooms
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.78,0:11:15.33,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's illogical, since Kagura Mea and I
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.33,0:11:18.47,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,have had zero interactions thus far
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.47,0:11:20.81,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,So, I don't really want to be compared with her
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.81,0:11:26.24,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,While Mea-chan's room isn't as clean as if it were cleaned by professionals,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.24,0:11:28.92,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,but it isn't so bad that things would
Dialogue: 0,0:11:28.92,0:11:31.32,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,start growing if she didn't bathe
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.32,0:11:34.01,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san's different, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.01,0:11:36.69,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry, but I don't want to be
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.69,0:11:40.12,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,compared with her. That's too much, even for me
Dialogue: 0,0:11:40.12,0:11:44.53,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I thought, "Ichinose Uruha's is so cute, there's no way
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.53,0:11:48.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,she can be *that* filthy, right?", so I went and looked it up
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.00,0:11:51.38,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Something like, "Ichinose Uruha Room"
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.38,0:11:53.56,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Then, a bunch of results showed up:
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.56,0:11:56.81,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Dirty room," "Filthy room," "Unbelievable...," etc.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.81,0:11:59.31,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I was like, "No way! Even though she's
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.31,0:12:01.95,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,that cute, her room is actually filthy?"
