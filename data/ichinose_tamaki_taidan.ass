Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.00,0:00:14.05,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I think it was Meika-kun's call-in stream or something

Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.08,0:00:17.65,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,so I sent you a friend request

Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.45,0:00:29.11,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Well, I suddenly got a friend request from you,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.11,0:00:33.82,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,so I thought I might have done something
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.82,0:00:36.39,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I was pretty surprised, so I decided to
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.39,0:00:38.91,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,just send you a hand wave for starters
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.91,0:00:41.65,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, so you were just testing out the waters with that?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.20,0:00:45.60,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I sent it like, "Ah, did you need something?"

Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.40,0:00:50.58,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,but I didn't think you were the type to
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.58,0:00:53.57,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,send a hand wave, but you did! Seeing that,

Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.11,0:00:59.08,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,hand waving type," so I waved my hand back
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.08,0:01:03.37,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Right, like, "Hello" "Good afternoon"
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.37,0:01:06.40,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Right, and after saying stuff like "Nice to meet you" and

Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.74,0:01:13.22,Translator,,0,0,0,,TLN: after Tamaki shows her good intentions, Ichinose replies that she had mistakenly assumed why Tamaki wanted to talk to her.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.74,0:01:12.22,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I got something like, "Ah, I was wrong"

Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.30,0:01:30.40,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,you would wonder why I was contacting you, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.40,0:01:33.78,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, in the first place, I don't really participate
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.78,0:01:36.73,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,in the FPS scene, so there wasn't much chance
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.73,0:01:39.37,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,for us to be in the same Discord server.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.37,0:01:42.70,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So when we were in Meika's server, I saw that Ichinose
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.70,0:01:45.69,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,was there, and thought, "Lucky!", and sent you a
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.69,0:01:47.78,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,friend request, but it seems like
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.78,0:01:49.82,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,you were a bit surprised by that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.82,0:01:54.21,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I was actually about it. I mean, it's not often
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.21,0:01:57.65,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,that you get friend requests, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.65,0:02:01.02,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, I guess not
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.02,0:02:04.32,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,But someone like me, who just randomly sends
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.32,0:02:07.72,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,friend requests, is quite rare, especially in
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.72,0:02:11.82,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,this industry, where most people are fairly reticent.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.82,0:02:14.91,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I saw it and was happy about it
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.91,0:02:16.57,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Thank you very much
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.57,0:02:19.86,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,That said, after I invited you for this stream,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.86,0:02:23.68,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,which you accepted, it's been several months, but have
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.68,0:02:28.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,you ever been on any other talking-focused streams?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.00,0:02:33.24,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Personally, I don't really think of myself as very suitable
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.24,0:02:38.13,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,for such streams, but Tamaki's conversation streams are
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.13,0:02:41.20,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,you know, quite well-known, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.20,0:02:44.62,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, well, the guests are well-known, yup.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.62,0:02:48.69,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I had seen a couple of them, and thought they were
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.69,0:02:51.44,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,interesting, so I was really happy
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.44,0:02:53.31,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,when you invited me on
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.31,0:02:57.42,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,As damage control, I preemptively said,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.68,0:03:01.71,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,with me, I'd be glad to participate."
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.71,0:03:05.46,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Right, you were like, "I'm totally ill-suited for this,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.46,0:03:08.83,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,and I don't know if I'll be able to talk, is that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.83,0:03:11.94,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,okay?", and I said that that was totally fine
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.94,0:03:17.31,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, some say I have Predator-level communication skills
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.31,0:03:21.02,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,For real, my intent today was to completely rely on you
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.02,0:03:24.17,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Today, when we were meeting up, I asked Ichinose,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.17,0:03:27.77,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Is it alright if I'm really talkative today?," and she was like,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.77,0:03:31.08,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Oh, I came today hoping you'd do exactly that, so I'd
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.08,0:03:34.28,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,be in a bit of a pinch if we can't make that happen"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.28,0:03:35.95,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's what I was thinking coming into this.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.95,0:03:38.40,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Thank you, then let's get talking a bunch
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.40,0:03:43.88,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I plan to talk about a lot of different topics with Nose today
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.68,0:03:48.34,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Okay, then, how about we start with the first question?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.14,0:03:50.97,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Alright, let's see what it is
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.97,0:03:53.65,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Please tell us how you came to know of each other
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.65,0:03:56.28,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,and what your respective first impressions were."
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.28,0:04:00.03,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, this is a fairly orthodox opener, but let's see..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.03,0:04:02.39,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san, do you remember when you
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.39,0:04:04.62,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,first learned of Inuyama Tamaki?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.62,0:04:08.67,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Inuyama Tamaki.. it was probably a clip, but I don't
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.67,0:04:12.28,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,remember which one specifically, since it was a
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.28,0:04:16.11,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,while ago, but I think you were with Kagura Mea...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.11,0:04:21.66,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,The clip was absolutely not wholesome at all,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.66,0:04:24.78,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,if I had to say, it was downright nasty.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.78,0:04:28.34,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I watched that and thought it was interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.34,0:04:30.97,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's how I learned of you.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.97,0:04:34.40,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,That's a terrible way to do so
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.40,0:04:37.88,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,My impression of you was... fairly... strong...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.88,0:04:40.57,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So you probably thought of me as someone
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.57,0:04:43.48,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,who got along with and resembled Kagura Mea
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.48,0:04:45.94,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's right
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.94,0:04:48.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,That kind of first impression... I don't like it..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.00,0:04:51.65,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I imagined you to be a foul-mouthed sort of person
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.65,0:04:53.54,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, I see
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.20,0:04:54.65,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I came with that impression
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.65,0:04:58.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,But, now, you think of me as a strong communicator, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.00,0:05:02.02,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, now.. I think you're good at talking, and, I
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.02,0:05:05.79,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,: also, your thumbnails are really good, cute,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.79,0:05:09.05,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,and easy on the eyes. Something like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.48,0:05:13.02,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I'd totally be willing to make thumbnails for you
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.02,0:05:15.83,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Actually, recently.. Recently?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.83,0:05:19.94,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I bought *that* recently, you know, Photoshop
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.70,0:05:20.06,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Recently?!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.06,0:05:22.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san, how long have you been a VTuber for, again?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.00,0:05:24.80,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Three years..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.97,0:05:24.40,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Oh, man, it's been a while
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.62,0:05:26.40,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I bought it to commemorate 3 years
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.40,0:05:28.97,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,To commemorate three years, huh? I see, so three years
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.97,0:05:31.02,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,is the bare minimum before using Photoshop.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.02,0:05:33.50,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,So, I bought it and started looking at how
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.50,0:05:36.53,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,other people were making their thumbnails, and, while
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.53,0:05:39.25,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I was doing that, I saw Tamaki-san's thumbnails
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.25,0:05:40.34,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Really? That makes me glad
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.34,0:05:42.05,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I thought they were good
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.05,0:05:44.57,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san, I can teach you how to use Photoshop
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.57,0:05:47.08,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Please do so
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.08,0:05:49.31,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I want to run a thumbnail making course
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.31,0:05:51.48,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I really want you to do so
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.48,0:05:54.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Should I? Let's do it over at Nose-san's channel, then
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.00,0:05:57.94,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,Please, I'll watch the archive over and over
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.94,0:05:59.94,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,You're really keen about this, aren't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.51,0:06:00.17,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I'll use it as reference
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.17,0:06:04.01,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Well, moving on from thumbnails, how I first found
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.01,0:06:08.12,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,out, how I first *properly* found out, about Nose-san
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.12,0:06:11.54,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,actually had something to do with Kagura Mea
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.54,0:06:13.75,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I was searching about myself on the Internet,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.75,0:06:16.07,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,and there were results about Kagura Mea and how
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.07,0:06:18.35,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,her room was, well, can't be said to be clean,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.35,0:06:21.10,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,as it's freaking disgusting, but, Nose-san's room,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.10,0:06:25.15,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,without sugar-coating it, is pretty bad, too, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.20,0:06:26.22,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's true ww
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.48,0:06:27.93,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So, with this uncommon common ground, you and
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.93,0:06:30.57,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Kagura Mea were seen as "comrades in filth," and
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.57,0:06:33.68,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,there were search results expressing a desire to see the
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.68,0:06:36.68,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,two of you duke it out over the filthiness of your rooms
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.68,0:06:40.23,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,That's illogical, since Kagura Mea and I
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.23,0:06:43.37,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,have had zero interactions thus far
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.37,0:06:45.71,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,So, I don't really want to be compared with her
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.71,0:06:51.14,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,While Mea-chan's room isn't as clean as if it were cleaned by professionals,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.14,0:06:53.82,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,but it isn't so bad that things would
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.82,0:06:56.22,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,start growing if she didn't bathe
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.22,0:06:58.91,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Nose-san's different, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.91,0:07:01.59,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry, but I don't want to be
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.59,0:07:05.02,Ichinose,,0,0,0,,compared with her. That's too much, even for me
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.02,0:07:09.43,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I thought, "Ichinose Uruha's is so cute, there's no way
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.43,0:07:12.90,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,she can be *that* filthy, right?", so I went and looked it up
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.90,0:07:16.28,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Something like, "Ichinose Uruha Room"
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.28,0:07:18.46,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Then, a bunch of results showed up:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.46,0:07:21.71,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,"Dirty room," "Filthy room," "Unbelievable...," etc.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.71,0:07:24.21,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,I was like, "No way! Even though she's
